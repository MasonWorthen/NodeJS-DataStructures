# node_structures
This contains a stack and queue data structure that can be used in any client or server side project. it implements these structures using javascript,linkedlist and generic arraylists. All the basic operations performed on these structures are constant time operation.If you need to quickly implement a Stack or Queue datastructure in Javascript then these classes will be more then sufficient to handle the the essential operations of a queue and stacks.


The queue relies on a linked list class to help perform the operations in constant time O(1) that include:
remove_end()
prepend()
remove_beginning()
append()
size()

The stack relies on a generic list to perform the operations in constant time those operations include:
push()
pop()

javascript-arraylist remove from beginning  O(n)
javascript-arraylist prepending to end O(n)
javascript-arraylist appending to end O(1)
javacript-arraylist remove from end O(1))

*Based on these operations above it would be best to make the end of the list the top of the stack
